# GitHub Integration

Integrating with Github allows reporting [status check](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-status-checks) for your commits and pull requests. Use the web dashboard Project Settings to add or edit Github Integration.

Sorry-cypress would update commit status to failure / success and provide a short tests summary status.
